> In Greek mythology, Gaia, the personification of the Earth, birthed Uranus, the personification of the Sky, and then united with him to produce the Titans, Cyclopes, and Hecatonchires. Among the Titans, Cronus, the youngest, overthrew his father Uranus by castrating him, which led to the birth of various beings, including the Furies and Aphrodite.

> We specialize in advanced cybersecurity adversarial engagement and defense. We firmly believe that comprehensive exposure surface enumeration and continuous, long-term asset monitoring are the paramount strategies for both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) operations. While 0-day exploits and universal scripts are indeed powerful winning tools, the true keys to victory lie in mastering the overall situation and maintaining a clear, detailed understanding of the cyber landscape. We see attack and defense not as separate entities, but as mutually reinforcing and organically integrated components.
