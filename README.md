# CRONUS-Develop

> In Greek mythology, Gaia, the personification of the Earth, birthed Uranus, the personification of the Sky, and then united with him to produce the Titans, Cyclopes, and Hecatonchires. Among the Titans, Cronus, the youngest, overthrew his father Uranus by castrating him, which led to the birth of various beings, including the Furies and Aphrodite.

> We specialize in advanced cybersecurity adversarial engagement and defense. We firmly believe that comprehensive exposure surface enumeration and continuous, long-term asset monitoring are the paramount strategies for both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) operations. While 0-day exploits and universal scripts are indeed powerful winning tools, the true keys to victory lie in mastering the overall situation and maintaining a clear, detailed understanding of the cyber landscape. We see attack and defense not as separate entities, but as mutually reinforcing and organically integrated components.

> 我们深耕于网络安全领域的深度对抗与防御。我们坚信，全面的暴露面梳理和长期持续化的资产监控才是红蓝对抗的根本之道。0day漏洞和“通杀”脚本固然是制胜的法宝，但真正决定胜负的，是对局势的掌控以及对网络空间的清晰梳理。我们认为，攻击与防御绝非孤立的两部分，而是相辅相成、有机整合的整体。
